NOTE: The business context is fictitious, however all planning and development of the solution is implemented following all the steps of a real market project.
You can follow the entire development of the project on notebook [c0.9-pa005-clustering-model-mindmap.ipynb](https://github.com/adrielepinto/clustering/blob/main/notebooks/c0.9-pa005-clustering-model-mindmap.ipynb)

# 1.0 BUSINESS PROBLEM

The company All in One Place is a Multibrand Outlet company, that is, it sells second-line products from several brands at a lower price, through e-commerce.
In just over 1 year of operation, the marketing team realized that some customers buy more expensive products, with high frequency and end up contributing a significant portion of the company's revenue.
Based on this perception, the marketing team will launch a loyalty program for base customers, called Insiders. However, the team does not have advanced knowledge of data to choose program participants.
For this reason, the marketing team asked the data team to program using advanced data manipulation techniques.


As part of the team of data scientists at the company AlI In One Place, who need to determine who are eligible customers to participate in Insiders. In possession of this list, the Marketing team will carry out a sequence of personalized and exclusive actions for the group, in order to increase revenue and purchase frequency.
As a result of this project, you are expected to deliver a list of people to participate in the Insiders program, along with a report answering the following questions:

## 1.1Questions to answer:
- Who are the eligible people for the Insiders Program?
- How many people will be in the group?
- Which are the main characteristics of these customers?
- What is the percentage revenue contribution coming from Insiders?
- What is the revenue expectation for the next few months?
- Which are the conditions for the people to be eligible from the program?
- Which are the conditions for the people to be removed from the program?
- What is the guarantee that the Insiders Problem is better than the rest of the base?
- What are the action the marketing team can do to enhance the revenue?


## 1.2 Understanding the Business Problem

# 4.0 Business Solution:

## 4.1 Solution Planning

The technique used to solve this problem was end-to-end method.
This process, objectively and quickly, allows you to deliver value to the business.
In the first cycle of the project, surface cleaning is carried out, an algorithm is chosen to model the data, and a metric is chosen to measure how much the model is improving or worsening. The objective is that in each cycle, modifications are made to the project to improve the accuracy of the model. Therefore, in the first cycle, the business already has a first version of the project, which will be improved with each cycle, to assist in decision making.

## 4.2 Solution Process
<img width="776" alt="Screen Shot 2023-09-18 at 10 57 44 AM" src="https://github.com/adrielepinto/clustering/assets/97919969/23871803-254e-4de0-98d2-600e5f07932c">

The process basically consists of collecting the data that is ready in a table on the Kaggle website, for download. After collecting, cleaning and separating the training, testing and validation data, train the algorithm that will make the model's predictions. Therefore, a table will be issued with the model's predictions. This model will be stored in an [AWS Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com) database, to make predictions on new data. By connecting to [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com), it will be possible to view this prediction in an organized way according to the similarities of each cluster, helping decision making.

# Three Data Insigths

 # H1. The customers of the cluster insiders has a amount (product) of purchase over 10% of purchase total;
True

<img width="749" alt="Screen Shot 2023-01-10 at 5 37 03 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97919969/211565828-a692878c-efab-48b4-b8ba-febedc69bc5e.png">

The Insider Program sell 61% more when it compared to the total database.

# H2. The customers of the cluster insiders has a amount (revenue) of purchase over 10% of purchase total;
True 

<img width="749" alt="Screen Shot 2023-01-10 at 5 38 04 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97919969/211566063-bbd56f31-b276-472f-bc20-7bac7b703eb3.png">



# H4. The revenue median by customers of the cluster insiders are 10% larger than the total revenue median;
 
True 

<img width="749" alt="Screen Shot 2023-01-10 at 5 40 17 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97919969/211566561-4f147f72-45db-444b-bea4-c099f97fff24.png">

The revenue median is 327.45% over than the total revenue median totalizing $2,624.26.

# 5.0 Space Study
The study of space basically refers to the use of techniques to reduce the dimensionalities of the feature space, where it will be summarized in just two features, separating the points in space and creating clusters. 
Tested tecnics:
- UMAP
- TSNE
- Tree Based
- 
<img width="856" alt="Screen Shot 2023-09-27 at 12 36 30 PM" src="https://github.com/adrielepinto/clustering/assets/97919969/cdff4363-3a44-4cc5-bc41-1e38a0d44384">

> Above, is possible to see how messy the feature space of the original dataset is.
> 

<img width="856" alt="Screen Shot 2023-09-27 at 12 36 49 PM" src="https://github.com/adrielepinto/clustering/assets/97919969/159201b6-7ac6-4949-a4c3-e29db87e5cbf">

Soon after dimensionality reduction, the  UMAP created more separate and cohesive clusters.


Therefore, the clustering process will now no longer be based on the original feature space, but rather on the reduction selected by UMAP.

# 6.0 Tested Machine Learning Models
Now is the time to experiment and see how machine learning algorithms respond.
- K-Means;
- GMM;
- Hierarchical Clustering;
- DBSCAN;


## 6.1 Machine Learning Modelling 
- KMeans:

<img width="829" alt="Screen Shot 2023-09-27 at 12 47 11 PM" src="https://github.com/adrielepinto/clustering/assets/97919969/605e170a-820f-43f3-8e9b-68c0f65077f1">



Both models had similar results, however the model has two specific results: a lack of flexibility in cluster shape and a lack of probabilistic cluster assignment â€“ meaning that for many data sets it may not work as well. as one might expect. The KMeans model groups the points by calculating the distance of the points from the centroids (points placed in the middle of the feature space), which moves until creating the clusters.

## 6.2 Machine Learning Metrics - Silhouette Score
The Silhouette Score metric evaluates whether the points were classified correctly, recalculating the point distances. Therefore, the Silhouette score includes the separation and cohesion of the cluster.

- The closer to 1 = means that the clusters are cohesive and distant from each other;
- 
- The closer to 0 = It means that the clusters are not as cohesive and that they are close to each other.
  
- The closer to -1 = Means that the dot was assigned to the wrong cluster.

<img width="810" alt="Screen Shot 2023-09-27 at 12 53 14 PM" src="https://github.com/adrielepinto/clustering/assets/97919969/6c086495-e133-4491-87d3-9c25c6e75e83">

To analyze the graph, the more the figure looks like a 'knife', it means that the point probably belongs to another cluster.
What we are looking for is a silhouette with visibly wider edges.


What can be seen in the graph above is that for the data used, the clustering is neither cohesive nor separate.

## 6.3 Sillhouete Score 

<img width="614" alt="Screen Shot 2023-09-28 at 9 24 28 AM" src="https://github.com/adrielepinto/clustering/assets/97919969/4a51547f-b0f6-4818-a845-b39fe2e2b3a0">

To separate the dataset into 4 clusters, sillhouette showed a score of 0.46. With the data used, this is the best results achieved, which can be improved in other project cycles.

# 7.0 Cluster Visualization 

<img width="848" alt="Screen Shot 2023-09-28 at 9 32 19 AM" src="https://github.com/adrielepinto/clustering/assets/97919969/241119c9-1756-4493-b8dc-539c206fcafb">

This is the visual results of the final clustering.


As in the real world, clustering doesn't always achieve the desired objectives. On the Graph, it is possible to notice that there are customers, that are grouped in the wrong cluster. As a data scientist, I tried to create features with the data from the dataset, which improve the results of the models. However, even with all the effort, the model tended not to identify customer similarities with excellence. Nevertheless, in another cycle, this result can be improved by collecting new data that helps in the separation and cohesion of the clustering.

# 8.0 Model Reaults

<img width="846" alt="Screen Shot 2023-09-28 at 9 47 08 AM" src="https://github.com/adrielepinto/clustering/assets/97919969/3e8d1baf-5fa1-4d38-a8f4-3319cca34158">

## 8.1 Assumptions:

What is a good customer?

- The customer who buys a large quantity of products;
- The customer who has a low recency.
- The customer who has a high frequency.


 The cluster that most identified with these criteria was cluster number 0.
 

Note: These criteria must be assumed in numbers by managers and those responsible for the business and passed on to the data scientist, however in this study, the manager was not present, I, as a data scientist, needed to assume the characteristics that define a good client for the company.

Customers who do not fit these criteria will be removed.


## 9.8 What is the guarantee that the Insiders Problem is better than the rest of the base?


<img width="679" alt="Screen Shot 2023-09-28 at 10 05 08 AM" src="https://github.com/adrielepinto/clustering/assets/97919969/62b212e6-4bd5-49b7-8006-44d03c6870fc">

- The garantee is that Insiders Program has increased the company revenue in 69%, compared to the total base, totalizing $10,104,658.35

## 9.9  What are the action the marketing team can do to enhance the revenue?

- Apply the clustering model;
- Increase the frequence from cluste 0.
- Indentify which products has more returns and why they are returning;
- Make the customer buy more expensive products;
- Create strategy to make the customer returns more often and decrease the recency;






# 10.0 Model into Production

 A demonstration of the result of the project. A database was created on AWS, which it needs to be constantly updated with new company data. For that, a structure was set up, where the script with the cleaning and transformation of the data, and trained model are run every scheduled time. Then the visualization can be seen through a Metabase, where the company can be based assembling graphs of visualization for decision making.
